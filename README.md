#Pomodoro Clock

This is a simple [Pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) I made that is written in Javascript with jQuery & HTML/CSS. Set a break and session length, and the clock will count down from the defined setting time. Once it reaches zero, it counts down from the defined break length, and then finally repeats the process. The break and session settings can only be set when the clock is not running.

###How To###

To use this Pomodoro clock, clone the repo and open the index.html file in a browser of your choice.
